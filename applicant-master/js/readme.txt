Task:
- Create a new JS project with any framework you wish (preferably angular2+)
- Use the following endpoint https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=10 to get information about pets.
- Display the information in a grid with 4 columns, each cell should display the name and image of the pet.
- Make the table with pagination in any way you wish (for example when I scroll all the way down 10 new pets will be displayed)
- Optional: Add unit testing to the project.
